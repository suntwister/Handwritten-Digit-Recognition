# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project is a handwritten digit recognition system using logistic regression. It is trained on the sklearn ready-made handwritten digit dataset to predict the class of digits (0-9). The goal is to showcase the model's performance in classifying handwritten digits
## Features

- Logistic regression-based classification of handwritten digits.
- Evaluation metrics analysis, including confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1 score, specificity, and balanced accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
